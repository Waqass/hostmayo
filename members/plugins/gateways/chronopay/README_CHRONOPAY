What is this?
-------------

This is a payment module built for use in ClientExec (www.clientexec.com) to integrate 
with the ChronoPay Credit card processor (www.chronopay.com).  It is based around a hosted payments page solution 
that ChronoPay offers.  This payment module performs once off initial payment processing and does not cover re-occuring
billing.  This function must be managed via the ChronoPay Client Interface.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

There are no additional system requirements to run this payment module that differ from the standard ClientExec 
requirements.  The module has been tested on the ClientExec 2.7.4.

All Packages must be set to the same currency that ChronoPay is set to process the credit card payment in.

SETTING UP CHRONOPAY
---------------------
Settings must be set in your ChronoPay account to interact with the ClientExec payment module.  

Log into your ChronoPay clients area and configure the following:

1. Login to https://clients.chronopay.com/.
2. Setup your site.  
	1. On the main menu go to setup.
	2. Click to 'List your sites'.
	3. Click 'Add new site'.
	4. Complete the Add site form.  The main field that is important is the Site name as this is displayed
		at the top of the payments form.
3. Setup the main product.
	1. On the main menu go to setup.
	2. Click on 'List your products'.
	3. Click 'Add new product'.
	4. Complete the add product form.  This is the product that will be used for all orders.  The price of the 
		product will be set dynamically via ClientExec.  The important fields are:

		** Product Name - not so important.  Recommend that you use your site name or url as it is shown in 
			payment form.
		** Product Type - Standard
		** Price - 1.00
		** Period - 0
		** Rebill Price - 0.00
		** Rebill Period - 0
		** Access URL - your site url + /plugins/gateways/chronopay/callback.php
			i.e. http://somedomain.com/plugins/gateways/chronopay/callback.php
			MOST IMPORTANT as this is the redirect on a successful CC processing.
		** Product username/password management - unchecked.



SETTING UP CLIENTEXEC
----------------------
1. UNZIP/UPLOAD all files contained in the ZIP package to your ClientExec installation root.  

	i.e.  This will install the following files:

		** <clientexec_root>/plugins/gateways/chronopay/callback_ipn.php
		** <clientexec_root>/plugins/gateways/chronopay/plugin.chronopay.php
		** <clientexec_root>/plugins/gateways/chronopay/index.html
	
2. Log into the ClientExec Admin and go to Admin > Plugins.  Click on the '3rd Party Billing' tab.  You will now 
	see 'ChronoPay' in the gateway list.

3. Turn 'In Signup' to 'Yes', and complete the fields:
	
	Product ID - Product ID of the product you set up in ChronoPay.
	Product Name - Name that will be displayed on the ChronoPay Hosted Credit Card Page.
	Language - Language of the ChronoPay Hosted Credit Card Page.
	Signup Name - Name that will be displayed on the ClientExec signup page.
