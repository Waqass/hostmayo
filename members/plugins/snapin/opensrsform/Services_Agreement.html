    (“Reseller”). Any reference to a “registry,” “Registry” or “Registry Operator”
    shall refer to the registry administrator of the applicable top-level domain
    (“TLD”). This Agreement explains our obligations to you, and explains your
    obligations to us for the Services. By agreeing to the terms and conditions set
    forth in this Agreement, you are also agreeing to be bound by the rules and
    regulations set forth by a registry for that particular registry only. </span></p>
  <p><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>2. SELECTION OF
    A DOMAIN NAME.</span></b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'> You
    acknowledge and agree that we cannot guarantee that you will obtain a desired
    domain name, even if an inquiry indicates that a domain name is available at
    the time of your application. You represent that, to the best of the your
    knowledge and belief, neither the registration of the domain name nor the
    manner in which you intend to use it, infringes upon the legal rights of a
    third party and further, that the domain name is not being registered for, nor
    shall it at any time whatsoever be used for, any unlawful purpose. During the
    period following registration of a domain name and the appointment of active
    name servers, we may post a stagnant web page and any revenues generated from
    same shall be for our own account. </span></p>
  <p><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>3. FEES.</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'> As consideration for the Services, you
    agree to pay Reseller the applicable service(s) fees prior to the effectiveness
    of a desired domain name registration or any renewal thereof. All fees payable
    hereunder are non-refundable even if your domain name registration is
    suspended, cancelled or transferred prior to the end of your current
    registration term. As further consideration for the Services, you agree to: (1)
    provide certain current, complete and accurate information about you as
    required by the registration process, and (2) maintain and update this
    information as needed to keep it current, complete and accurate. All such
    information shall be referred to as account information (&quot;Account
    Information&quot;). You represent that the Account Information and all other
    statements put forth in your application are true, complete and accurate. Both
    Tucows and each registry reserves the right to terminate your domain name
    registration if: (i) information provided by you or your agent is false,
    inaccurate, incomplete, unreliable, misleading or otherwise secretive; or (ii)
    you have failed to maintain, update and keep your Account Information true,
    current, complete, accurate and reliable. You acknowledge that a breach of this
    Section 3 will constitute a material breach of our Agreement, which will
    entitle either us or a registry to terminate this Agreement immediately upon
    such breach without any refund and without notice to you. </span></p>
  <p><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>4. TERM.</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'> This Agreement will remain in effect
    during the term of your domain name registration as selected, recorded and paid
    for at the time of registration or any renewal thereof. Should the domain name
    be transferred to another registrar, the terms and conditions of this Agreement

    MODIFICATIONS TO AGREEMENT.</span></b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'> You acknowledge that the practice of registering and administering domain names
    is constantly evolving; therefore, you agree that Tucows may modify this
    Agreement, or any other related and/or applicable agreement, as is necessary to
    comply with its agreements with ICANN, a registry or any other entity or
    individual, as well as to adjust to changing circumstances. All amendments to
    this Agreement will be posted on our website. Your continued use of the domain
    name registered to you will constitute your acceptance of this Agreement with
    any revisions. If you do not agree to any change, you may request that your
    domain name registration be cancelled or transferred to a different accredited
    registrar. You agree that such cancellation or request for transfer will be
    your exclusive remedy if you do not wish to abide by any change to this
    Agreement, or any other related and/or applicable agreement. </span></p>

  <p><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>8. DOMAIN NAME
    DISPUTES.</span></b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'> You agree that,
    if the registration or reservation of your domain name is challenged by a third
    party, you will be subject to the provisions specified in the dispute policy
    adopted by the applicable registry. You agree that in the event a domain name
    dispute arises with any third party, you will indemnify and hold us harmless
    pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the applicable policy. If
    Tucows is notified that a complaint has been filed with a judicial or
    administrative body regarding your domain name, Tucows may, at its sole
    discretion, suspend your ability to use your domain name or to make
    modifications to your registration records until (i) Tucows is directed to do
    so by the judicial or administrative body, or (ii) Tucows receives notification
    by you and the other party contesting your domain that the dispute has been
    settled. Furthermore, you agree that if you are subject to litigation regarding
    your registration or use of your domain name, Tucows may deposit control of
    your registration record into the registry of the judicial body by supplying a
    party with a registrar certificate from us. </span></p>
  <p><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>9. POLICY.</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'> You agree that your registration of the
    domain name shall be subject to suspension, cancellation, or transfer pursuant
    to a Tucows, registry, ICANN or government-adopted policy, or pursuant to any
    registrar or registry procedure not inconsistent with a Tucows, registry, ICANN
    or government-adopted policy, (1) to correct mistakes by us or a registry in
    registering the name or (2) for the resolution of disputes concerning the
    domain name. </span></p>
  <p><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>10. AGENCY.</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'> Should you intend to license use of a
    domain name to a third party you shall nonetheless be the domain name holder of
    record and are therefore responsible for providing your own full contact
    information and for providing and updating accurate technical and
    administrative contact information adequate to facilitate timely resolution of
    any problems that arise in connection with the domain name. You shall accept
    liability for harm caused by wrongful use of the domain name. You represent
    that you will secure the agreement of any third party to the terms and
    conditions in this Agreement </span></p>

    the right to distribute information to you that is pertinent to the quality or
    operation of our services and those of our service partners. These
    announcements will be predominately informative in nature and may include
    notices describing changes, upgrades, new products or other information to add

  <p><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>12. LIMITATION
    OF LIABILITY. </span></b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>You agree
    that our entire liability, and your exclusive remedy, with respect to any
    Services(s) provided under this Agreement and any breach of this Agreement is
    solely limited to the amount you paid for the initial registration of your
    domain name. Tucows and its directors, employees, affiliates, subsidiaries,
    agents and third party providers, ICANN and the applicable registries shall not
    be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential
    damages resulting from the use or inability to use any of the Services or for
    the cost of procurement of substitute services. Because some states do not
    allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental
    damages, in such states, our liability is limited to the extent permitted by
    law. We disclaim any and all loss or liability resulting from, but not limited
    to: (1) loss or liability resulting from access delays or access interruptions;
    (2) loss or liability resulting from data non-delivery or data mis-delivery; (3)
    loss or liability resulting from acts of God; (4) loss or liability resulting
    from the unauthorized use or misuse of your account identifier or password; (5)
    loss or liability resulting from errors, omissions, or misstatements in any and
    all information or services(s) provided under this Agreement; (6) loss or
    liability resulting from the interruption of your Service. You agree that we
    will not be liable for any loss of registration and use of your domain name, or
    for interruption of business, or any indirect, special, incidental, or
    consequential damages of any kind (including lost profits) regardless of the
    form of action whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise,
    even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. </span></p>
  <p><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>13. INDEMNITY.</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'> You agree to release, indemnify, and hold
    Tucows, its contractors, agents, employees, officers, directors and affiliates,
    ICANN, the applicable registries and their respective directors, officers,
    employees, agents and affiliates harmless from all liabilities, claims and
    expenses, including attorney's fees, of third parties arising out of or
    relating to the registration or use of the domain name registered in your name,
    whether used by yourself, licensed to a third party or pursuant to the Whois
    Privacy Service, including without limitation infringement by you or a third
    party with access to your Account Identifier and Password. You also agree to
    release, indemnify and hold us harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions
    contained in the applicable Dispute Policy. When we are threatened with suit by
    a third party, we may seek written assurances from you concerning your promise
    to indemnify us; your failure to provide those assurances may be considered by
    us to be a breach of your Agreement and may result in the suspension or
    cancellation of your domain name. This indemnification obligation will survive
    the termination or expiration of this Agreement. </span></p>
  <p><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>14. TRANSFER OF
    OWNERSHIP. </span></b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>The person
    named as Registrant on the Whois shall be the registered name holder. The
    person named as administrative contact at the time the controlling account
    identifier and password are secured shall be deemed the designate of the
    Registrant with the authority to manage the domain name. You agree that prior
    to transferring ownership of your domain name to another person (the
    “Transferee&quot;) you shall require the Transferee to agree, in writing to be
    bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If the Transferee
    fails to be bound in a reasonable fashion (as determine by us in our sole
    discretion) to the terms and conditions in this Agreement, any such transfer
    will be null and void. </span></p>
  <p><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>15. RENEWALS
    AND FORFEITURE</span></b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>. Domain
    names are registered for a finite period of time. You will receive reminders
    immediately prior to the expiration of your registration inviting you to renew
    your domain name and specifying the amount of time you have to renew your
    domain name. In the event that you fail to renew your domain name in a timely
    fashion, your registration will expire and we may, at our discretion, elect to
    assume the registration and may hold it for our own account, delete it or we
    may sell it to a third party. You acknowledge and agree that your right and
    interest in a domain name ceases upon its expiration and that any expired
    domain name may be made available for registration by a third party. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>If you fail to
    renew your registration, your domain name may cease to resolve and visitors to
    your site may be redirected to a default page informing them that the site is
    no longer in service. This parked or default page may feature advertisements
    posted by us for our own account. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>If we, in our sole
    discretion, have elected to renew the registration, you will be entitled to a
    grace period of forty (40) days during which you may re-register the domain
    name from us. Additional costs for the redemption and re-registration will
    apply. During this grace period, we may post a parked page and/or may revise
    the “Whois” registration records to include either our information or that of your
    Reseller. The domain name also may be listed for auction and promoted as being
    available for auction. If the name is sold during any such auction, it will be
    acquired by a third party and will not remain available for re-registration by
    you after our stated grace period. If you do not re-register the domain name
    during the grace period, the auction sale will be concluded and ownership of
    the domain transferred to a third party. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>If you fail to
    renew your domain name registration during the grace period, you acknowledge
    that you have abandoned the domain name and that it is available for sale and
    registration by any third party. </span></p>
  <p><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>16. BREACH. </span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>You agree that failure to abide by any
    provision of this Agreement, any operating rule or policy or the Dispute Policy
    provided by us, may be considered by us to be a material breach and that we may
    provide a written notice, describing the breach, to you. If within thirty (30)
    calendar days of the date of such notice, you fail to provide evidence, which
    is reasonably satisfactory to us, that you have not breached your obligations
    under the Agreement, then we may delete the registration or reservation of your
    domain name. Any such breach by you shall not be deemed to be excused simply
    because we did not act earlier in response to that, or any other breach by you. </span></p>

    jeopardize the security of Registry or others to do so. Registry reserves the
    right to immediately discontinue e-mail forwarding without notice if the
    technical stability of e-mail forwarding is threatened in any way, or if you
    are in breach of this Agreement. On discontinuing e-mail forwarding, Registry
    is not obliged to store any contents or to forward unsent e-mail to you or a
